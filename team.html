            <h2>Alex Bechke</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Alex Bechke. I am a senior Software Engineering student with a minor in Computer Science at Kennesaw State University with a passion for learning, software development, and video games. I am currently looking for an internship in the summer time because I want to get my foot in the door in the software engineering industry as quickly as possible. One day it is my dream to say I developed or helped developed an application that changed someone’s life for the better. I feel as my dream can come true by working on our senior project “Safe Kid” as we’re developing this app to help teach children with autism basic contact information such as phone numbers, addresses, and names.</p>

            <h2>Ross Murphy</h2>
            <p>I love hands-on Work where i can Discover, and Create, Solutions. To me, Understanding how something works is incredibly satisfying, and the thrill of solving a problem is what i seek in work. I am a graduating senior who will be completing a Bachelor’s of Science in Software Engineering this summer from Kennesaw State University. Most of my work experience has been in jobs pertaining both to technical and customer service, and consider one of my strongest skills to be my ability to connect with the customer and give them a positive experience that has them wanting to return. In my opinion, how you treat your customers is paramount to developing the kind of trust that leads to referrals and repeat business. I have a strong interest in the areas of web development and embedded systems, and hope to be able to continue to develop my skills further in the future.</p>
