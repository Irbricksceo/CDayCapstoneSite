            <p>Young children and children with disabilities often have deficiencies in vocal communication or issues processing information. In cases of emergency, these children become vulnerable if they are not able to recall and communicate personal information. Safe Kid provides activities for children to learn names, phone numbers, and addresses. Safe Kid is designed in a way to engage and teach children with disabilities. Safe Kids understands that these children have unique learning needs and includes visual and audible cues to foster retention.  </p>
