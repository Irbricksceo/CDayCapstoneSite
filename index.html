            <p>Safe Kid is a phone application that helps children learn personal information. In an emergency, children need to be able to communicate their name, their guardian's phone number, and their address. Safe Kid teaches children personal information through games and levels of ‘difficulty’ to reinforce learned information. 
                Through Safe Kid a child can begin learning information through games of repetition and pattern recognition. To reinforce understanding, Kid Safe implements visual cues and textual cues with colors and shapes. Safe Kid uses internal metrics to measure the learning progress of the user and encourage independence. The user will move from matching sub-sections of information to recitation of whole sections of information.
